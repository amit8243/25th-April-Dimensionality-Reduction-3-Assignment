    "#Dimensionality Reduction-3 Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach?\n",
    "Explain with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: PCA handles data with high variance in some dimensions and low variance in others by capturing and\n",
    "emphasizing the dimensions with the most significant variance. Here's how PCA addresses this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling or Standardization: Prior to applying PCA, it is common to scale or standardize the data. This \n",
    "step ensures that all dimensions are on a similar scale and prevents variables with higher variances \n",
    "from dominating the analysis solely based on their magnitude. Scaling the data allows PCA to focus on \n",
    "the relative variances across dimensions rather than their absolute magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance-based Ranking: PCA identifies the principal components based on the variance explained by each \n",
    "component. Principal components associated with higher eigenvalues capture more variance in the data. \n",
    "Therefore, PCA naturally prioritizes dimensions with higher variances and assigns them greater \n",
    "importance in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: PCA allows for dimensionality reduction by selecting a subset of the principal\n",
    "components that capture the most variance in the data. If certain dimensions exhibit high variances \n",
    "while others have low variances, the principal components corresponding to the high-variance dimensions\n",
    "will be selected, while those associated with low-variance dimensions may be ignored or given less \n",
    "importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retained Information: When performing dimensionality reduction, PCA aims to retain a certain proportion\n",
    "of the total variance in the data. By selecting the principal components with the highest variances, it\n",
    "ensures that the most important and informative dimensions are preserved, even if some dimensions have \n",
    "low variance. This approach allows PCA to focus on the dimensions that contribute the most to the \n",
    "overall variance in the data, regardless of individual variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, PCA handles data with high variance in some dimensions and low variance in others by \n",
    "identifying and prioritizing the dimensions with the most significant variance. It achieves this \n",
    "through variance-based ranking of principal components and dimensionality reduction that retains the \n",
    "most informative dimensions while discarding or downplaying the dimensions with low variances. By \n",
    "emphasizing the dimensions with higher variances, PCA effectively captures the most relevant patterns \n",
    "and structures in the data, regardless of the variation across different dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Eigen decomposition, also known as eigenvalue decomposition, is a fundamental concept in linear \n",
    "algebra that allows us to decompose a matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It is an important \n",
    "tool in various mathematical and computational applications. Here's an explanation of eigen \n",
    "decomposition and its significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen Decomposition:\n",
    "Given a square matrix A, eigen decomposition expresses A as the product of three components: \n",
    "A = VDV^(-1), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "V is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A.\n",
    "D is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding eigenvalues of A.\n",
    "The eigenvalues represent the scaling factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or \n",
    "contracted when multiplied by A. Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by A, result \n",
    "in a scalar multiple of themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance of Eigen Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagonalization: Eigen decomposition allows the diagonalization of a matrix, which is advantageous for \n",
    "matrix computations. Diagonal matrices have desirable properties, making them easier to manipulate and \n",
    "analyze than general matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Powers: Eigen decomposition is used to compute powers of matrices efficiently. For example, \n",
    "A^n can be computed by raising the diagonal matrix D to the power of n while keeping the eigenvectors V\n",
    "unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Matrix Properties: Eigen decomposition provides insights into the properties of a matrix.\n",
    "The eigenvalues reveal information about the matrix, such as its determinant, trace, rank, and \n",
    "invertibility. The eigenvectors provide information about the directions along which the matrix behaves\n",
    "differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving Systems of Linear Equations: Eigen decomposition helps solve systems of linear equations. By \n",
    "expressing the matrix equation Ax = b in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, solutions can be \n",
    "obtained efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Similarity: Eigen decomposition enables the concept of matrix similarity. If two matrices have \n",
    "the same eigen decomposition, they are considered similar, which has implications for various matrix \n",
    "operations and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Decomposition: Eigen decomposition is a key component of spectral decomposition, which \n",
    "decomposes a matrix into its spectral components. Spectral decomposition is crucial in various fields, \n",
    "including quantum mechanics, signal processing, and graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Eigen decomposition is utilized in PCA to find the principal \n",
    "components and their associated variances. PCA is widely used for dimensionality reduction, data \n",
    "visualization, and feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen decomposition is a powerful tool in linear algebra, allowing us to understand the properties of \n",
    "matrices, solve systems of linear equations, compute matrix powers, and perform transformations. Its \n",
    "significance extends beyond linear algebra to various fields where matrices and linear transformations \n",
    "play a vital role in understanding and analyzing complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:  A square matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue of A is equal to its geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "The minimal polynomial of A has no repeated roots.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue of A is equal to its geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "Then, there exists a basis of eigenvectors for A. This means that we can write A as a product of three\n",
    "matrices: a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, a matrix of eigenvectors, and a matrix of inverse \n",
    "eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A = diag(λ1, λ2, ..., λn) * V * V^(-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure. A square matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue of A is equal to its geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "The minimal polynomial of A has no repeated roots.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue of A is equal to its geometric multiplicity. \n",
    "Then, there exists a basis of eigenvectors for A. This means that we can write A as a product of three\n",
    "matrices: a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, a matrix of eigenvectors, and a matrix of inverse \n",
    "eigenvectors.\n",

    "Code snippet\n",
    "A = diag(λ1, λ2, ..., λn) * V * V^(-1)\n",
    "Use code with caution. Learn more\n",
    "where λ1, λ2, ..., λn are the eigenvalues of A, V is the matrix of eigenvectors of A, and V^(-1) is the \n",
    "\n",
    "matrix of inverse eigenvectors of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that the minimal polynomial of A has no repeated roots. Then, the eigenvalues of A are all\n",
    "distinct. This means that the matrix of eigenvectors V is invertible, and the Eigen-Decomposition of A \n",
    "is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, suppose that A is diagonalizable. Then, the Eigen-Decomposition of A is well-defined, which\n",
    "means that the matrix of eigenvectors V is invertible. This means that the algebraic multiplicity of \n",
    "each eigenvalue of A is equal to its geometric multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the \n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition approach are that the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue of A is equal to its\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach?\n",
    "How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The spectral theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that states that every symmetric \n",
    "matrix is diagonalizable. This means that every symmetric matrix can be written as a product of three \n",
    "matrices: a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, a matrix of eigenvectors, and a matrix of inverse \n",
    "eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem is significant in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach because it \n",
    "guarantees that every symmetric matrix can be decomposed using this method. This makes the \n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition approach a powerful tool for analyzing symmetric matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonalizability of a matrix is a property that determines whether or not a matrix can be \n",
    "decomposed using the Eigen-Decomposition approach. A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its \n",
    "eigenvalues are all distinct. This means that the matrix of eigenvectors V is invertible, and the \n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition of the matrix is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how the spectral theorem and the Eigen-Decomposition approach can be used to \n",
    "analyze a symmetric matrix. Let's say we have the matrix A = [2 1; 1 3]. The eigenvalues of A are \n",
    "λ1 = 5 and λ2 = 1. The eigenvectors of A are v1 = [1; 1] and v2 = [-1; 1]. The Eigen-Decomposition of\n",
    "A is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = diag([5 1]) * [v1 v2] * [v1' v2']\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that A can be expressed as a product of three matrices: a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, a \n",
    "matrix of eigenvectors, and a matrix of inverse eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem guarantees that every symmetric matrix can be decomposed using the \n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition approach. This makes the Eigen-Decomposition approach a powerful tool for \n",
    "analyzing symmetric matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "The eigenvalues of a matrix are the scalars that, when multiplied by a vector, result in the vector being stretched or shrunk in a specific direction. The eigenvectors of a matrix are the vectors that are stretched or shrunk by the eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, you can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the characteristic polynomial of the matrix. The characteristic polynomial is a polynomial whose\n",
    "roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",
    "Set the characteristic polynomial to zero and solve for the roots. The roots of the characteristic \n",
    "polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(eigenvalues)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will print the eigenvalues of the matrix A, which are 5 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of a matrix represent the scaling factors that determine how an eigenvector is \n",
    "stretched or shrunk when it is multiplied by the matrix. For example, if the eigenvalue of a matrix is 2,\n",
    "then the eigenvector will be stretched by a factor of 2 when it is multiplied by the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of a matrix can be used to understand the structure of the matrix and to solve linear \n",
    "systems of equations. They can also be used to analyze data and to reduce the dimensionality of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Eigenvectors are vectors that, when multiplied by a matrix, are simply scaled by a factor called \n",
    "the eigenvalue. The eigenvalue is the factor by which an eigenvector is stretched or shrunk when it is\n",
    "multiplied by a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a matrix A and an eigenvector v. If we multiply A by v, we get Av = λv, \n",
    "where λ is the eigenvalue associated with v. This means that the vector v is stretched or shrunk by a \n",
    "factor of λ when it is multiplied by A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors are related to eigenvalues in the following way: if a vector v is an eigenvector of a\n",
    "matrix A with eigenvalue λ, then we have the following equation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Av = λv\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation means that the vector v is scaled by a factor of λ when it is multiplied by the matrix A.\n",

    "They are a valuable tool for anyone who works with matrices or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues is that they represent the directions\n",
    "in which a matrix stretches or shrinks vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors are the vectors that are stretched or shrunk by the eigenvalues of the matrix. For example,\n",

    "The eigenvector v1 points in the direction that is stretched by a factor of 5 when it is multiplied by \n",
    "A.\n",
    "The eigenvector v2 points in the direction that is stretched by a factor of 1 when it is multiplied by \n",
    "A.\n",
    "The eigenvalue λ1 = 5 represents the scaling factor that determines how the eigenvector v1 is stretched\n",

    "\"\"\"Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Eigendecomposition is a powerful tool that has a wide range of real-world applications. Some of the\n",
    "most common applications of eigendecomposition include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA): PCA is a statistical method that uses eigendecomposition to reduce \n",
    "the dimensionality of data. PCA is used in a variety of applications, such as image processing, machine\n",

    "Eigendecomposition is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems in a variety \n",
    "of fields. It is a valuable tool for anyone who works with matrices or data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\"\"\"Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This is because the \n",
    "eigenvectors of a matrix are only defined up to a scalar multiple. For example, if v is an eigenvector\n",
    "of a matrix A with eigenvalue λ, then any scalar multiple of v is also an eigenvector of A with \n",
    "eigenvalue λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the matrix A = [2 1; 1 3] has two sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The first set is \n",
    "v1 = [1; 1] and λ1 = 5, and the second set is v2 = [-1; 1] and λ2 = 1. Both sets of eigenvectors and \n",
    "eigenvalues are correct, but they represent different directions in which the matrix A stretches or \n",
    "shrinks vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a matrix can have as many sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues as there are distinct \n",
    "eigenvalues. However, if a matrix has repeated eigenvalues, then the number of sets of eigenvectors and\n",
    "eigenvalues will be less than or equal to the number of distinct eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be determined by the algebraic multiplicity of \n",
    "the eigenvalues. The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the number of times that the eigenvalue\n",
    "appears in the characteristic polynomial of the matrix. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is \n",
    "the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue. The number of sets of \n",

    "the data onto the principal components, the dimensionality of the data can be reduced without losing\n",
    "too much information.\n",
    "\n",
